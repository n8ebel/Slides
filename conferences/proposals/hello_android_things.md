Ready to start building the Internet of Things, but arenâ€™t sure where to start?

Android Things enables you to use familiar Android development tools to build smart, connected devices.

Exciting? Yes!  

However, if you're lacking in hardware experience you might feel a bit overwhelmed. That's the position I was in when I picked up my first Android Things development kit.

In this talk, you'll go from 0 to ready to build with Android Things including:
- what hardware & tools to use?
- just what exactly do all those I/O acronyms mean?
- how to install & update the OS?
- how to build and deploy a simple new project?
- what new & familiar tools/libraries can you leverage to build exciting, smart, connected devices of your own?
