___

> **_What advice would we give ourselves?_**

___

# To the Time Machine

^ that depends?
^ how where can our time machine take us?

^ let's look a few periods during an early career in androiddev

^ specific advice might change, but there are themes that are applicable

- Finding your first job
- Growing into your first role
- Building your career

___

> **_Finding Your First Job_**

# Finding Your First Job
- define your goals
- don't chase a resume checkmark
- think about your interests, your passions, your ideal self

- honestly evaluate companies and whether they serve in reaching those goals
- know _why_ you are interviewing at a company


- don't disqualify yourself
- requirements are flexible
- it is enough to be a capable engineer

- experience comes in many forms
- highlight what you have


___

> **_Starting Your First Job_**


# Starting Your First Job
- Where is your desk?
- What is expected of you?
- How does your team build software?
- Where and how are bugs tracked?
- What's a sprint? What's a scrum?
- Where's the code?  How is it structured?
- Where is the coffee machine?

## **So Many Questions**

# So many questions

- How do you feel about those questions?

^ embarrassed? shame?

- Are you comfortable with "I don't know"?

- Having many, many questions is perfectly normal
- That is exactly where you're supposed to be
- You don't have to know everything
- Nobody else does

> "Not asking questions is a sure fire way to hold back your learning over time" [^1]

[^1]:Craig Russell → `@trionkidnapper`

# Want to be more productive?
- ask about tools, shortcuts, patterns, libraries

^ i didn't know about intelliJ
^ i didn't know about genymotion

# Want to plan more manageable sprints?
- be honest about your abilities, knowledge, and expectations
- communicate openly with your team/manager
- ask how you can develop those skills

# Shouldn't You Know These Things?
- They already hired you.  
- You have the skills and are worth investing in
- You are enough
- Open and honest curiosity and learning is the best way to develop that investment
