# Blazing Your Trail

## **You Are Not Alone**

# You Are Not Alone
we are in this together, but not the same

- validation and confirmation that everyone struggles

___

___

# Takeaways

1. Don't tie "lines of code" to happiness

^ or projects, or meetups, or blog posts, etc

2. Everyone feels overwhelmed at times
3. You wont know everything
4. There's no "one size fits all" approach
