# You Are Not Alone
we are in this together, but not the same

- engaging with local and online communities

- blogging, sharing, mentoring great way to stay up to date, to learn
- validation and confirmation that everyone struggles

___

if i could go back in time, there are so many things i could share with myself.  so many things to be learned and experienced

the catch is that you can't learn it all at once.

in fact it takes time.  a lot of time.  so much time that we will never know it all

# Takeaways

1. everyone feels overwhelmed at times
2. you wont know everything
3. there's no "one size fits all" approach
