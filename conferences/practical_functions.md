## Abstract
Kotlin is here to stay, and with it, functions. How are Kotlin functions different from Java methods? What types of functions are there, and what does that mean for your codebase?

In this talk you'll learn different types of functions: top-level, extension, infix, higher-order, etc.

You'll learn how and when to use these functions to write cleaner, safer coder; drawing on practical examples such as:
- Handling `null`
- Replacing helper/utility classes
- Refactoring classes
- Asynchronous control flow

Finally, you'll discover useful functions from Kotlin's standard library, android-ktx, and more that you can immediately start using to improve your code.
