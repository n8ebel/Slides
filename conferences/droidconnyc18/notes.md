# Benefits

## Personal Benefits

- There's a lot more freedom to my day, and ability to spend relatively more of my time with my family. Also, we're able to live in a place where I can enjoy a cost of living that's more reasonable than the big city.
- Flexibility of work, saves travel time
- No commute time. Less distractions. Flexible working environment

## Team Benefits

- I think it's easier to achieve a diversity of cultures with a team that doesn't strictly have to be in the same place.

- Though counterintuitive, it's actually *easier* for me to schedule meetings & check-ins with my team. I don't need to find large conference rooms, and I can work from home more often, giving me the option to schedule time early or late in the day, without concern for commuting. The normal advantage gained from being in the office - to be there in-person for the team - isn't really useful when 90% of the team is remote anyway.

- More diversity

- Flexible environment, more diverse talent pool, Canadian jokes.


# Challenges

## Personal Challenges
- It's easy to feel disconnected from the thrust and excitement of the company, and to be marginalized. When there are days full of meetings, spending the entire time in one chair in front of a screen is super painful.
- The goodies that you get when you are on site. Sometimes it is easier to explain stuff in-person than remotely if you are not good at communication skills
- More distractions (possibly). Relies heavily on self discipline.

- too much time at home
- less socialization
- less organic breaks

## Team Challenges

- Especially as a lead, I occasionally need to schedule meetings just to have the team casually communicate about something in a high-bandwidth manner. It doesn't just happen by accident as much.
- What I lose most are not the planned meetings, but the extremely quick asides and side-chats that arise when you physically work near someone. Losing those can add up over time. I also have some of my best work discussions over lunch, and that's obviously not an option with teammates who are remote. Additionally, you just get to know your teammates better as people when you can more easily verbally communicate, I've found, and knowing people better makes it easier to work with them, especially when disagreements or misunderstandings arise. So I think what we lose are a lot of the really small interactions that are easy to forget about until they're not there anymore.
- Regular sync ups are required
- If there are a lot of OOOs it can feel lonely. Canadian jokes.

### Time Zones
- Not really, partly because I'm in the middle of the spread for my team. It is kind of nice to start my day before most of the folks in HQ are really rolling, so that I can get some key things done before distractions start pouring in.

- Yeah, it's a bit of a challenge, but it depends on the timezone. For our India developer, it's quite tough, because it's literally night & day when it comes to the offset in time. This makes it incredibly tough to get in sync on even basic questions or misunderstandings. However, within North America, our remote east coast devs are amazing at being responsive during times that they know are "working hours" on the west coast. I think that's why it's worked well - a lightweight expectation exists there, which I'm sure poses some challenges for those developers in their own lives, but keeps our team in sync.

- It will pose significant challenge only if team is not understanding of the fact that there is a time zone difference or one team feel superior than the other. If both remote and onsite developer understands the time zone difference and have proper expectations set up, it does not cause much issues.

- Very slightly. You have to be willing to accept some response time lag if interfacing at end-of-day / beginning-of-day for other time zones. There are definitely ways around it and you have to be smart about what things you can continue to work on asynchronously.

### Technical
- Yes - your internet connection is your lifeline. If your router is acting up or the neighborhood goes out, you've effectively disappeared. Even an occasionally spotty connection can mean the difference between being heard in a group setting and getting passed over by the momentum of a meeting. Also, getting a good headset and figuring out camera issues are key.

- Maybe not what you're looking for, but recently when Josh's laptop failed, he couldn't just go to Jamal for a loaner laptop. I think they told him to buy a new laptop at the Apple Store and return it within the free return window, but this was a huge hassle and ended up not being long enough (you'll have to ask him for the full story, I had trouble following it :-p). But in the end it created a lot of frustration.

- Yes. sometimes when you are stuck in some trivial problem and can't seem to find the solution of it, then you need someone to help you out.

- Ensuring a good/stable internet connection. Having a proper space setup to minimize temptations

- avoid being blocked


# Communication
intentiality

Having a Slack channel that everybody hangs out in is great, but doesn't solve all of the communication needs. I set a much lower threshold for when to start a video call/screenshare, as it's often helpful beyond the matter at hand.

Large unstructured meetings usually don't work well in person, but they are 10x worse when it happens with a remote team.

Be pro-active in communication and set the right expectations

Pair programming is okay
- Being freely able to video/phone conference
- Having meetings (google suite) automatically set up with video conference rooms. Having meeting rooms automatically set up to dial into said video conferences
- Automatically having video conferencing attached to meetings so there isn't a question if dialing in is need or not.

It seems silly, but when you're ONLY communicating with coworkers via text channels, it's easy to come off cold and terse. I think it's important to take the extra time to be friendly over text and add things like emojis. We give off these nonverbal emotional cues in person all of the time, but they don't come for free over text channels!

# Engagement
Coming together in a single place a couple of times a year is key.
Slack is actually a fantastic resource for building team culture by sharing links, jokes, stories, etc. Also regular stand-ups. Even if the content of the stand-ups aren't 100% useful, just being able to see everyone's faces together can strengthen bonds that may normally not occur. I think it's also important for the leaders on the team to to encourage a bit of smalltalk or at least non-serious banter, because while that will happen naturally in person, over VC that tends to get filtered out in lieu of serious discussion.
Regular sync ups and value each other views.
- In-person travel meetup once in a while
- Have weeks where everyone is working on the same thing (tech-debt week) to break up the monotony of people always on different projects.
