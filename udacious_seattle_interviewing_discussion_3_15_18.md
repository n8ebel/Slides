# Refine Your Personal Statement

The technical aspect is only 1 part of an interview

Your first impression can set the tone for the entire interview
A strong first impression can lead an interviewer to look more favorably on mistakes or other "red flags" during the interview

___

# Refine Your Personal Statement

When an interviewer asks "Tell me about yourself", have a well thought out response

Know what you're skills, interests, and "brand" are

Use this as the chance to sell yourself to the interviewer in the best way you know how

___

# Refine Your Personal Statement

Have a unique thought, opinion, or insight regarding the company/team/product

Interviewers (especially on small teams) want to hire people excited to work there

Be ready to answer:
- *"why do you want to work here?"*
___

# Refine Your Personal Statement

Be prepared to answer the following
- *"tell me about a difficult technical challenge"*
- *"tell me about a recent project"*
- *"what do you want to work on?"*
- *"what do you hope to learn in the next year?"*

___

# Refine Your Personal Statement

Practice these questions & answers

Do not underestimate how impactful the non-technical portion of an interview can be

If you're well prepared for a first impression and the "chit chat" portion of the interview, it will give a lot of confidence

___

# Study the Company/Team/Interviewer/Role

> *"interviewers like genuine interest & enthusiasm for a role"*

Be able to demonstrate the following
- your interest for the product/team
- how you can bring value to the team
- an interest for a particular topic or technology
- perhaps find a personal project of the interviewer and ask them about it

___

# Practice

> *Like anything, becoming comfortable with interviewing takes practice*

___

# Practice
## How can you practice?

- make up flashcards and have someone ask you to explain topics & questions
- record your 5 minute "personal statement", listen, refine, and record again
- practice writing code with pen/papger and/or on a whiteboard
- use sites like Leetcode to practice the technical algorithmic questions
- seek out mock interviews, and get feedback on your performance

___

# Other Tips

Interviewing Is Uncomfortable... and that's okay

- your performance in an interview does not equate to your worth as a potential employee or especially as a person in General

- interviewing is a largely flawed system
- you're likely to go through some frustrating interviews

- remember to stay calm, ask questions, think out loud.  The process is often more important than the answer
