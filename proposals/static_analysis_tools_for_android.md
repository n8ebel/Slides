How can you be sure you're following best practices, enforcing coding conventions, 
and catching bugs before they hit production?

You can ensure these through code review, but the human element is error prone and
developers would often rather be writing code.  It can be time consuming to review for
tedious things like code styling, and can lead to a frustrating review process.

In this talk, you learn how you can leverage static analysis tools to write more 
consistent, safer, higher-quality code while leaving developers free to focus on the
more interesting aspects of code review.  

You'll learn how enable, customize, and analyze results from a number of tools including:
- Android Lint
- detekt
- ktlint

You'll then understand how to integrate these tools into your build process to ensure
high quality code on every commit.
