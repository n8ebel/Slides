How can you be sure you're following best practices, enforcing coding conventions, and catching bugs before they hit production?

In this talk, you'll learn how you can leverage static analysis tools to consistently write higher-quality code without slowing down, or frustrating, your development team.

You'll learn how enable, customize, report and analyze potential issues from tools such as:

- Android Lint
- detekt
- ktlint

We'll then explore how to seamlessly integrate these tools into your build process to ensure high quality code on every commit.
