Ready to start building the Internet of Things, but arenâ€™t sure where to start?

Android Things makes this easier by enabling you to leverage your existing knowledge, tools, and services to build smart, 
connected devices. However, the process can seem a bit foreign at first.

In this talk, you'll learn step by step how to build a connected smart display as we walk through the following questions:

- what hardware is needed to get started?
- how to train a custom TensorFlow Lite model?
- how to use Firebase to distribute and update your model to edge devices?
- how to consume your model on your Android Things hardware?
- how to use the model to load & display data from Firebase depending on what it sees?
