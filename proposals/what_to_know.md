## Title
What Do You Need To Know To Be An Android Developer?

## Abstract
"What do you need to know to be an Android developer?"

Maybe you're a student, a new dev, or just built your first "Hello World" app, 
I think this question is really important.  

While it's easier than ever to learn online, it's not easy
to find career advice or outlined learning paths.  To truly build a more 
representative developer community we need to make it easier and more
welcoming for those trying to get into the field.

In this talk, we'll illuminate a learning path and shed light on what's
really important to becoming an Android developer by examining the following:

- What makes you an "Android developer"
- Which libraries do you need to know?
- Should you learn Java or Kotlin first?
- How do you stay up to date?
- What skills are most important?

And finally, we'll explore the idea that nobody else has it all figured out either.
