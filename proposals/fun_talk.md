## Abstract
How do you know what type of fun()ction you need when developing with Kotlin?

Whether starting from scratch, or migrating an existing app to Kotlin, there are a number of function options to choose from; top-level functions, extension functions, higher-order functions, infix… the list goes on.

The types of functions you choose, and how you use them, can have interesting ramifications for your projects, and give you the freedom to reimagine how you build Android applications.

In this talk you’ll learn:
- How to write basic Kotlin functions
- The different types of Kotlin functions: top-level, extension, higher-order, single-expression, local, etc...
- When to leverage different function types
- How to call your new Kotlin functions from Java
- How Kotlin functions impact how you build your app?
